Work History

Invenn - January 2011 to Present
================================

Started Invenn, a software company. Tasks include software development and
product and requirements gathering. During this time I created several Drupal
modules to achieve the business ends for the client. Notable Drupal apis used
include Views, Services and DB. Also developed AddIns for Autodesk Revit using
C# in Visual Studio.

40K Foundation Australia - November and December 2010
=====================================================

Volunteered at the 40K Foundation (they've opened a bridging school in
Bangalore for children of quarry workers). In just a short time I upgraded
their network to use a PDC. I also set up mediawiki and sugarcrm to encourage
knowledge sharing in the organisation. LDAP was used for access control.

KFC Roofing Supplies - June to November 2010
============================================

* Designed and produced content for promotion of products.
* Created catalog and catalog generation software (excel vba).
* Created job ads and interviewed to hire a replacement.

DesignInc Architects - Summer 2009-2010
=======================================

At DesignInc I researched the feasibility of creating a web interface that
displays the checking of building parameters by directly linking with the cad
software (Revit). This was a successful experiment and I wrote my final report
on the topic.

Quotify - Summer 2008-2009
==========================

Working as a junior maintenance programmer exposed me to alot of developer
tools. Systems such as bug trackers, automated build systems and agile
management with daily scrums. Though I had briefly used scm before I learnt to
apply it in a team environment. Performed maintenance tasks on code base with
little documentation available. Learnt how to use remote debugging with xdebug.
